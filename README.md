# Raspberry Pi Voice Assistant Robot - Orbit

## Version 1

Welcome to Orbit, your intelligent voice assistant powered by cutting-edge technology. Orbit is designed to answer any questions you throw at it, thanks to the robust hugchat library. To get started, simply provide your hugchat login email and password in the code.

### Features:

- **Hugchat Integration:** Utilizes LLM models hosted on Hugging Face, specifically LLama-2 and Mistral, to deliver accurate and insightful responses.

- **Status Indicators:** The RGB LED provides visual cues for different phases of the robot, indicating whether it's listening, processing, or responding. The animated eyes enhance the overall appearance of the robot, making interactions more engaging.

- **Audio Input/Output:** Equipped with a Bluetooth speaker and microphone connected to the Raspberry Pi 5, Orbit ensures seamless speech recognition and response output. If needed, the code can be easily modified to handle type input and print output.

## Version 2 - Coming Soon

Stay tuned for the next evolution of Orbit, where we're introducing exciting new features:

- **Human Detection:** Integrated sensors will allow Orbit to wake up only when someone approaches, conserving energy and enhancing user interaction.

- **Face Recognition:** With an integrated camera, Orbit will be able to recognize and greet familiar faces. After the first encounter, it will remember people for more personalized interactions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your Raspberry Pi.
2. Install the packages in the requirements.txt file.
3. Modify the code to include your hugchat login credentials.
4. Connect a Bluetooth speaker and microphone to the Raspberry Pi for optimal performance.
5. Run the code and start interacting with Orbit!

Hope you enjoy using Orbit, and we're excited to bring you even more features in Version 2. Feel free to contribute, report issues, or suggest enhancements to make Orbit an even smarter and more capable voice assistant.
